            <p
              ><strong>1. How do you manage projects and timelines? </strong></p
            >

            <div class="milestone-image">
              <img
                src="assets/media/images/Blog/project-milestone-imeline.jpeg"
                alt="#" />
            </div>

            <strong>Explanation</strong>
            <p
              >A reliable agency should have a clear project management process
              and timeline. Do they use Agile sprints with set deliverables each
              week, or a more traditional phased schedule? Ask them to outline
              how they will take your project from start to finish. A
              well-structured timeline with milestones is a sign they plan
              properly (remember, poor planning is a top reason projects fail).
            </p>

            <p
              >You want to hear that they use tools (like Trello, Asana, or
              Jira) and hold regular check-ins to keep everything on track. This
              question will reveal if the agency is organized or if they‚Äôre just
              winging it day by day.
            </p>

            <strong>üö© Red Flag: </strong>

            <p
              >Vague answers or a lack of a formal timeline. If they can't
              explain their process or say something like ‚ÄúWe'll figure it out
              as we go,‚Äù that's a huge warning sign. An agency that
              <strong>cannot detail how they manage deadlines</strong> might
              leave you waiting until next Christmas for a site that was
              promised for this summer. Also be wary if they dodge specifics on
              handling delays or scope changes - it could mean they don't handle
              them well at all.
            </p>

            <p
              ><strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> A great answer would be something
              like:
              <i
                >‚ÄúWe use an Agile approach. Your project will be broken into
                2-week sprints with a detailed roadmap. We‚Äôll provide a timeline
                with key milestones (design completed by X date, site live by Y
                date) and update you weekly. If anything threatens a deadline,
                we communicate immediately and adjust with your approval.‚Äù </i
              >This shows the agency has a <strong>system,</strong> not just
              good intentions.

            <p
              ><strong
                >2. Who will be my main point of contact (and how do we
                communicate)?
              </strong></p
            >

            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

            <p
              >Communication can make or break a project. You should know
              exactly who to turn to with questions or updates. Will you have a
              dedicated project manager (PM) or account manager? Or will you be
              communicating directly with developers and designers? Also clarify
              how you‚Äôll communicate ‚Äì will they set up a Slack channel for
              real-time chats, send weekly email updates, or schedule regular
              calls?
            </p>

            <p
              >Understanding this upfront sets the right expectations on both
              sides. A good agency will proactively introduce you to a
              <strong>dedicated PM</strong> who shepherds your project and keeps
              you in the loop. Consistent communication means fewer surprises
              for you.
            </p>

            <p><strong>üö© Red Flag: </strong></p>

            <p
              ><i>
                ‚ÄúJust email our support and whoever‚Äôs available will respond.‚Äù </i
              >If an agency can‚Äôt tell you
              <strong>who is responsible for client communication,</strong>
              that‚Äôs a major red flag . You don‚Äôt want to be bounced around or
              wondering who to call when something comes up.
            </p>

            <p
              >Similarly, if they say they ‚Äúrotate team members based on
              availability,‚Äù think twice ‚Äì you might end up re-explaining your
              project to new people constantly. Lack of a dedicated point of
              contact often leads to miscommunication and things slipping
              through the cracks.
            </p>

            <p
              ><strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Look for an answer like:
              <i
                >‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have a dedicated PM, <strong>Sarah,</strong> who will
                be your go-to person. She‚Äôll be available via email and Slack,
                and we schedule a 30-minute check-in call every Friday to
                discuss progress.‚Äù</i
              >
              A specific answer with a name and communication plan shows that
              the agency values transparency and accountability. It‚Äôs reassuring
              to know
              <strong>exactly who has your back</strong> and how you can reach
              them whenever needed.

            <p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p>

            <p
              >This question digs into how the agency works on a technical level
              and how flexible they are with changes. Many quality agencies
              follow Agile methodologies ‚Äì meaning they work in iterative
              sprints (often 1-2 weeks long) and deliver the project in
              increments.
            </p>
            <p
              >Others might use a phase-based (waterfall) approach. Neither is
              inherently wrong, but you want to know what to expect. More
              importantly, ask how they handle it if you want to change
              something or add a feature after development is underway ‚Äì because
              let‚Äôs face it, things evolve once you see the work in progress.
            </p>
            <p
              >An experienced team will have a change management process: for
              example, they might log new requests, assess the impact on
              timeline/cost, and get your approval before proceeding. This keeps
              everyone on the same page and avoids chaos if the project scope
              needs adjustment.

              >‚ÄúChanges? Sure, we can just squeeze them in anytime for free.‚Äù
              Beware of any agency that says yes to every change without
              discussing impact ‚Äì they might be overpromising just to win you
              over. On the flip side, an agency that says ‚ÄúNo changes allowed
              once we start‚Äù is equally concerning; inflexibility could mean
              they care more about their process than your needs.
            </p>
            <p
              >Also be cautious if they seem confused by the concept of sprints
              or can‚Äôt clearly explain their development workflow. A
              disorganized approach here could lead to muddled work and
              finger-pointing later.
            </p>
            <p
              ><strong>üí° Pro Tip: </strong>A strong answer might be: ‚ÄúWe follow
              Agile. Every two weeks we plan sprint goals, and you‚Äôll get to
              review what‚Äôs been built. If you request changes after we start,
              we have a formal process ‚Äì we‚Äôll evaluate the change, let you know
              if it affects the timeline or budget, and only proceed once you
              approve. All changes are documented so nothing gets forgotten.‚Äù
              This tells you the agency is both methodical and flexible ‚Äì the

              things you need are not included.  º</p

            <p
              >For example, if they never mention ongoing support or important
              features in the proposal, they might intend to charge separately

              <strong>üí° Pro Tip: </strong> Look for an agency that can
              <strong>itemize</strong> or clearly enumerate what you‚Äôre getting.
              A great answer might be: ‚ÄúOur proposal includes UX/UI design for X

              2 rounds of design revisions, and 1 month of post-launch support.
              It doesn‚Äôt include the Shopify subscription, any premium app fees,
              or long-term maintenance ‚Äì we can handle those for additional cost
              and we‚Äôll list those options out.‚Äù This level of detail shows
              honesty. They‚Äôre not afraid to spell out what‚Äôs included (and not)
